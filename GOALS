Development Goals:
	Decoder Modules:
		*_init(struct sp* env)
			-this should initialize the codec
			-it should bundle it's assets in env->data
			-the convention for this is a struct fmtname_data
			-modules must place their data in a struct fmtname_data, even if it has only one member
			-it should return 0 on success
			-it should return a standardized negative value to signify a specific ERROR
		*_encode(struct sp* env)
			-this function is expected to handle all values of env->size
			-it's not required to NULL check input currently but perhaps it should
			-this function should return the number of bytes used from the input on success
			-this function should not modify env->size or env->input directly
			-error return values are iffy at this point, since input may be consumed whether or not
				an error occurs, an error reporting member of struct sp may be required
			-standardized negative return values will therefore be the current convention
		*_deinit(struct sp* env)
			-this function destroys all non-automatic assests of the codec if possible
			-it is expected to operate without serious error and return 0
		*(sp_module_t *env)
			-is the dispatcher function for the module
		*_auto(sp_module_t *env)
			-chaining works, but the module always sends SPOP_DECODE this limits the flexibility
				of the soundplayer api, I wanted to avoid relying on a struct member to determin
				the requested operation since it might have a residual/uninitialized value that
				is inappropriate for the task at hand. I'm going to do both for compatibility
				_auto() is the function that handles checking the modules state and mode members
				to effectively chain the output.
		struct fmtname_data{}
			-this should be allocated on the heap during initialization not declared as static
