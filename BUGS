This is the bugs and features list.

selecting an output module is too crude in sp. it'd be nice to make more options of the output modules available from the commandline.

mp3 module still segfaults? It doesn't sefault in modtest, which uses tried and true fread to pump input into the module, so it must be a problem with sp.

modtest works with most modules but doesn't handle things like spc that want at least 0x10200 bytes of input before the init function will succeed. Of course a workaround is to set the BUF_SIZE bigger.
